# Description

The Subform Repeater Plugin is a great alternative for the enterprise "Form Grid" field element.

The Subform Repeater Plugin allows you to design a form and add a subform that is repeated (as in multiple rows) to display child records and at the same time open a new top or bottom row for data entry. Subform Repeater Plugin does not pop up a new browser window "Form Grid" style.

The Subform Repeater is very flexible as it allows you to configure many options (load and save datasource, validations, subform appearance etc.).
