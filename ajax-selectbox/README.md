# Description



The AJAX Select Box Plugin is a new Form Field Element plugin that uses AJAX to retrieve and populate the select box options based on the selected datalist. Users can type in the search filter and it will dynamically retrieve the available options as the user continues to key in.

This is a demonstration app to show the usage of the AJAX Selectbox form element plugin for Joget DX.
