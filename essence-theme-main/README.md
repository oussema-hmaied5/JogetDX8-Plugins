## Getting Started  
Once you've installed this theme plugin, you can start using it in UI builder by selecting this as your application theme.

## Components and Usage  
This theme is compatible with other Joget themes that support responsive views, light/dark themes, and RTL mode. Additionally, this theme provides more customization options. Please refer to the information below.

### 1. Menu Layout
The menu layout options provide users with versatile choices to tailor their interface according to their preferences. There are four distinct types of layouts available:

**Light Sidebar**
The light sidebar layout offers a clean and minimalist design, providing users with a bright and spacious interface. It is ideal for users who prefer a visually light and unobtrusive navigation panel.

**Dark Sidebar**
In contrast, the dark sidebar layout presents a sleek and sophisticated appearance, featuring dark colors and subtle accents. This layout is suitable for users who prefer a more dramatic and modern aesthetic.

**Light Header**
The light header layout integrates navigation elements into a light-colored header, offering a streamlined and compact design. It is well-suited for users who prioritize simplicity and efficiency in their interface design.

**Dark Header**
Similar to the dark sidebar layout, the dark header layout incorporates navigation elements into a dark-colored header. It provides a stylish and refined look, making it an excellent choice for users seeking a sleek and professional interface design.

### 2. Dark Mode
The Dark mode option not only enhances aesthetics but also offers practical benefits such as reducing glare, conserving battery life on devices with OLED displays, and improving readability in dimly lit conditions.

### 3. Font Settings
This feature pertains to the ability to select fonts for a Joget application. When the option to use local fonts instead of Google Fonts is disabled, it means that the Joget application will utilize Google Fonts for its typography needs.

Users have the flexibility to choose fonts directly from a curated list of Google Fonts, which are hosted by Google and readily available for integration into the Joget application. They can browse through the list and select the font that best suits their design preferences and requirements.

### 4. Form Field/Label Settings

**Rounded Field Design**
The "Rounded Field Design" is characterized by form fields with rounded corners, providing a softer and more modern aesthetic compared to traditional rectangular field designs. In this style, the corners of the input fields are rounded to create a visually appealing and cohesive appearance across the form.
